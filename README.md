# Placement outcomes for PhD graduates in Economics

I construct a novel dataset with individual-level data on PhD placement outcomes over the period 2012-2022 for a total of 24 economics departments
worldwide. Specifically, data is extracted directly from the relevant departmental websites using a mixture of both code and no-code web scraping tools. 

Placements are then sorted into 8 different categories using a text classification algorithm, namely tenure-track (academic) positions, 
post-docs, central banks, international organizations, government, think-tanks, private sector, and other (academic) positions.

This GitHub repository hosts the codes for replicating the analysis. A one-click code for running the full sequence of scripts can be found in the dofile `_master.do`.
